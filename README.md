# Face-Emotion-detection

This repository focuses on facial emotion detection using a pretrained VGG19 model. By employing transfer learning techniques, the project achieves a maximum validation accuracy of 0.64 without overfitting on the training data. Additionally, some preliminary data analysis was conducted before training the model to ensure optimal performance.
